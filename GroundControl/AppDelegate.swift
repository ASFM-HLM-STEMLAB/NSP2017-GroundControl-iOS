// ASFM - Near Space Program - Capsule Ground Control APP.
//
// This APP is used to get data from the NSP Server, See SocketCenter for more details.
//
// --> MAIN FILE DESCRIPTIONS:
// MapViewController.swift = Display individual report locations in a UiMapKit View.
// ReportInfoViewController.swift = Shows the data of the latest report.
//
// Report.swift = Struct [Model] to abstract all report data in an easy to read, write and display object.
// SocketCenter.swift = Singleton class used to encapsulate and centralize all network communications.
//

// TODO : Test Mission Stage Changing
// TODO : External Sensor Parsing in ExtInstrumentsVC
// TODO : Implement in server sending messages thru satcom
// TODO : Update only relevant data in instrument display
//B= TimeStamp, Lat, Lon, Alt, ExtTemp, ExtHum, ExtPress
//A= TimeStamp, Lat, Lon, Alt, Speed, HDG, GPS_SATS, GPS_PRECISION, BATTLVL, IRIDIUM_SATS, INT_TEMP, STAGE
