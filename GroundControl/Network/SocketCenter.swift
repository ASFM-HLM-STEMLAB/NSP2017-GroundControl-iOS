// This class is used as a central repository to control comunication to and from the server that holds the data from the capsule.

// How does it work:
// The capsule talks to the server by sending a message either thru cellular modem or satellite modem. Every message sent to the server (Movic.io) is stored in a database for later retrieval and also relayed to all active GroundControl apps connected to the server.
//
//
//
// We use Sockets to talk to the server instead of the classic REST method. So we use a more robust realtime/push comunication protocol instead of polling every N seconds or so new messages. So this is far more efficient way of bi directional communications. Socket coding is a bit more challenging because it is not stateless so we have to know where we are in the communication process at all times. So say we want to ask for the latest message, we ask the server for it but we have to remember what we asked for, so when the server responds we know that message corresponds to that request.
//
// Socket.io is a framework that helps us simplify that process by adding abstraction layers to it to simplify the process. This class uses that framework to talk to and from the server. We then leverage the iOS notification framework to notify any part of the app that wants to be notified of any interested events.
