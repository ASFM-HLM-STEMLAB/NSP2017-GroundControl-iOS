// Comunications to Server:
// This class is used as a central class to manage comunications to/from the server that in turn talks to the capsule.
// We use this 3 part paradigm so that we have a central repository that holds all the information sent by the capsule at all times.
// We then connect using this app to the server to pull that information and to ask the server to relay messages to the capsule.
//

// How does it work (in detail):
// The capsule talks to the server by sending a message either thru cellular modem or satellite modem at defined intervals.
// Every message sent to the server (Movic.io) is stored/presisted in a file for log keeping and also relayed to all active GroundControl apps that are connected to the server at that moment.
// In this fashion we will pull the history upon connecting and then listen to new messages as the arrive.
//
// The server is always listening for new messsages form the capsule. Once it receives a new message it saves it, and broadcast it to every ground control station that is connected to the server.
//
// So the server is capable of receiving messages from the capsule and also managing multiple connections from ground control apps.
//
//
// We use Sockets as a low level way to talk to the server instead of the classic REST (PUT/PUSH/GET) methods used in stateless applications.
// This method allows for a more robust realtime/push comunication protocol instead of polling every N seconds or so for new messages. This is similar like whatsapp and other chat services work. In this kind of applications this is far more efficient method for bi directional communications in real time. Socket coding is a bit more challenging because it is not stateless so we have to know where we are in the communication process at all times to react accordingly. For instance if a disconnect happens we need to try to reconnect to restablish communications and keep retrying until we connect. Also we need to know what we requested so that when the server responds we have some conext of what it is saying to us.
//
// To simplify this process we use a library/framework called Socket.io.
// Socket.io abstracts and simplifies the whole socket com process by adding methods and boiler plate code that help us concentrate on the business logic rather than on the tiny details of the protocol implementation. This class [SocketCenter] concentrates and encapsulates all networking and communication methods in one place and uses SIO (Socket.io) framework to talk to and from the server. We then leverage the iOS notification framework to notify any part of the app that wants to be made aware of any interesting events.
